quick notes on how to create this calculator

keep track of

- first operand
- second operand
- current operator
- if we are performing a calculation rn (something like inCalculation or toCompute)

basic workflow of the calculator
first operand = second operand = null
current operator = null
toComputer = null

user can press operator and utility buttons only if first operand is not null

make everything work in the console first

user presses a button:

if operator or utility button is pressed and first operand is still null 
    then return
else 
    check if button is an operand, utility or operator

    if button is operand 
        then just push digit to first operand string
    else if button is utility 
        then perform the utility\*
    else if button is operator 
        then check if second operand has already been typed
        if second operator has not been typed yet
            then set current operator to appropriate operator and toCompute to true
        else if

--------------------------------

let firstOperand = secondOperand = currentOperation = null, toCompute = false

if firstOperand === null then user can only click on numbers
else if firstOperand has already been selected user can click again on number button or choose an utility or operator button


--------------------------------

let firstOperand
let secondOperand
let currentOperation

operate(){
    if the first operand doesnt exist || the operation is not set then do nothing and return
    else{
        if there is no second operand then second = first

        if currentOperation = "add" then perform add, 
            set firstOperand to result, you can press again and repeat the last operation
        do the same for the other operations

        set justcompleted to true
    }
}

number buttons on click{
    if !toCompute then
        if first operand not set || justCompleted then initialize it with button digit and set justCompleted to false
        else push the digit to the end of the first operand eg. 5, press 3 -> 53
    else if toCompute then 
        do the same as above but for second operand
}

operator buttons on click{
    call operate with right argument based on the content of the button or something
}

think later about utils later

also remove justCompleted
